KEYWORDS
--------

NODE
POD
CONTAINER


NODE : REPRESENTS MACHINE

POD : POD HOLDS CONTAINER (S)

CONTAINER  : ITS AN INSTANCE OF ANY IMAGE 




ADVANTAGES OF POD
-----------------

1. APPLICATION CONTAINER (S)
2. STORAGE RESOURCES
3. A UNIQUE NETWORK IP 


FEATURES OF KUBERNETES
----------------------

1. AUTOMATIC BIN PACKING
2. SERVICE DISCOVERY
3. LOAD BALANCING
4. STORAGE ORCHESTRATION
5. SELF - HEALING 



STORAGE ORCHISTRATION
---------------------

1. CONTAINERS RUNNING INSIDE A POD MAY NEED A STORE DATA
2. PODS CAN HAVE A STORAGE VOLUMES
3. USUALLY A SINGLE VOLUME IS SHARED WITH IN ALL THE CONTAINERS IN A POD


SELF HEALING 
-------------

1. IF CONTAINER FAILS - IT RESTARTS THE CONTAINER
2. IF NODE DIES - REPLACES AND RESCHEDULE  CONTAINERS ON OTHER NODES
3. IF CONTAINER DOES NOT RESPOND - BY HEALTH CHECK - KILL CONTAINER 



SECRET
------

DATA LIKE PASSWORDS AND OTHER TOKENS ARE HANDLED USING SECRET
IT A KUBERNETES OBJECT
EACH SECRET CANNOT EXCEED MORE THAN 1 MB



BATCH EXECUTION
---------------

1. BATCH JOBS REQUIRE AN EXECUTABLE TO RUN TO COMPLETION 
2. DURING JOB EXECUTION ID ANY CONTAINER FAILS OR POD FAILS, 
JOB CONTROLLER WILL RESCHEDULE THE CONTAINER POD ON ANOTHER NODE



JOBS TYPES
----------
1. SEQUENTIAL 
2. PARALLEL


HORIZONTAL SCALING 
------------------

WE CAN PERFORM SCALE UP AND SCALE DOWN 

1. USING COMMANDS
2. FROM THE DASHBOARD
3. AUTOMATIC BASED ON CPU USAGE


KUBERNETES OBJECTS FOR HORIZONTAL SCALING 

1. REPLICATION CONTROLLER 
2. REPLICA SETS 



KUBERNETES CLUSTER 
------------------

MASTER

	MANAGER
	CONTROLPLANE 


 
WORKER

	WORKER

YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE WORKER MACHINE IN THE CLUSTER 


TEAM 
	COMBINATION OF MASTER AND WORKER MACHINES
	KUBERNETES CLUSTER 


ALL KUBERNETES COMMANDS EXECUTES ON MASTER MACHINE


SO WE CAN ALSO HAVE MORE THAN ONE MASTER MACHINE TO BALANCE THE FAILOVER SITUATION FOR MASTER 


1. WHEN WE INSTALL KUBERNETES YOU GET A CLUSTER 
2. SET OF MACHINES CALLED NODES
3. ATLEAST ONE WORKER AND ONE MASTER NODE IS REQUIRED.


MINIONS - WORKER NODES (OLDER VERSION)


IN MANAGER NODE - KUBERNETES COMMANDS WILL GET EXECUTED 
WORKER NODE - PODS AND CONTAINERS WILL GET CREATED 



NODES CAN BE 

1. PHYSICAL MACHINE
2. VIRTUAL MACHINE
3. VM ON CLOUD







KUBERNETES CAPACITY 

NO MORE THAN 
------------

5000 NODES
150000 PODS
300000 CONTAINERS

100 PODS PER NODE 



THERE ARE 4 COMPONENTS IN MASTER NODE

1. API SERVER
2. SCHEDULER 
3. CONTROLLER MANAGER
4. ETCD 




API SERVER
----------

1. FRONT-END SERVER 
2. COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER APPLICATIONS 
3. EXPOSES APIS FOR EACH APPLICATIONS
4. INTRACTS WITH KUBERNETES CLUSTER 


CONTROLLER MANAGER 
------------------

TWO TYPES
---------

1. KUBE CONTROLLER MANAGER 
2. CLOUD CONTROLLER MANAGER 


KUBE CONTROLLER MANAGER 
-----------------------
THERE ARE 4 TYPES

1. NODE CONTROLLER
2. REPLICATION CONTROLLER
3. ENDPOINT CONTROLLER
4. SERVICE ACCOUNTS AND TOKEN CONTROLLER


NODE CONTROLLER - NOTICES AND RESPONDS WHEN NODES GOES DOWN 

REPLICATION CONTROLLER - MAINTAINS CORRECT COUNT OF PODS FOR EACH REPLICATION

ENDPOINTS CONTROLLER - JOINS SERVICES AND PODS

SERVICE ACCOUNTS AND TOKEN CONTROLLER - CREATE DEFAULT ACCOUNTS AND API ACCESS TOKEN FOR NEW NAMESPACES



CLOUD CONTROLLER MANAGER 

THERE ARE 4 TYPES 

1. NODE CONTROLLER
2. ROUTE CONTROLLER 
3. SERVICE CONTROLLER
4. VOLUME CONTROLLER





WORKER NODE COMPONENTS 
----------------------

1. KUBELET
2. KUBE PROXY
3. CONTAINER RUNTIME


ADDITIONAL SERVICES
-------------------

1. KUBERNETES DASHBOARD 
2. MONITORING 
3. LOGGING
4. DNS



POD LIFECYCLE

CREATION HAPPENS BASED ON MANIFEST INFO

1. PENDING
2. RUNNING
3. SUCCEEDED
4. FAILED
